# Pomo

A simple timer built with tomatos in mind.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MCluck90/pomo
$ cd pomo
$ cargo build --release
```

Then add `pomo/target/release` to your PATH or copy `pomo/target/release/pomo[.exe]` and `pomo/target/release/resources`
to somewhere in your PATH.

## Usage

```shell
pomo [--rest] <time>
```

`time` is in minutes.

The `--rest` option changes the messaging to indicate that you're starting a rest period.
